  bio: [
   "I am fascinated by origins of biodiversity and by what keeps it going despite multiple mass extinction events. My work asks why some branches of the tree of life are staggeringly diverse while their close relatives are not, using chelicerates including spiders, ticks, mites, scorpions, whip spiders, camel spiders as a study system.",
   "Before starting the lab I completed a Ph.D. with Gustavo Hormiga at George Washington University on the spider tree of life and the miniature orb-weavers, and a postdoc with Prashant Sharma at the University of Wisconsin-Madison working on arachnid phylogenomics and genome architecture.",
   "Outside the lab I coordinate SpiderIndia, a community science network of more than 9,000 people across South Asia who photograph and document spiders. Much of what we know about where Indian spiders actually live comes from them. Their contributions have led to the popular A field guide to the Spider Genera of India"
